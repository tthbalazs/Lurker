# Lurker - Low effort Reddit reader for those who don't care
I found that the official Reddit mobile client is very heavy, and has a ton of features that I don't care about or don't need at all. I'm building this light(er) weight version mostly for myself, just for fun.
I'm also streaming it when I get a chance, so if you're interested come and find me at [https://www.twitch.tv/swansondev](https://www.twitch.tv/swansondev) and build it with me!
